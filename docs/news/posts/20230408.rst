Final Version 4 Release (v4.1.5)
====================================

This is the last release of |EX-CS| before we move to version 5

This is just a minor bugfix release from the previous version 4.1.2. This release is a Bugfix release to fix the initialization order to benefit Ethernet boards, to fix GitHub issue #299 related to TurnoutDescription, and to fix command parsing for LCN (the Layout Control Nodes Accessory Network).

There is also 'Updated' DCC-EX 4.1 & JMRI DecoderPro 5.2+ Getting Started Guide.pdf in our documents downloads page on the Website here:
