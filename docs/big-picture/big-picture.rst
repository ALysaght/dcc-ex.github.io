Putting it all together - the Big Picture
******************************************

A common topic that arises in Discord conversations is the question "How does it all fit together?".

We have a great core product (CommandStation-EX) with great features such as built-in automation (EX-RAIL) along with many integration options (JMRI, WiThrottle, Engine Driver), support for various different integrated hardware devices (IO expanders, sensors, audio) and now even an integrated turntable controller (Turntable-EX), however, how does one take all these bits and pieces and use them together cohesively to control and/or automate an entire layout?

This brand new section of our website is aimed to answer just that!

Over the coming weeks and months we will build this section out with diagrams, information, and EX-RAIL examples to demonstrate how our fictional layout can be configured, controlled, and automated with CommandStation-EX and various other supported components and features.

We call our demonstration layout "Railway Modeller's Fictional Trains" (or RMFT for short) as it is completely fictional, and will only exist on this website for instructional purposes.
