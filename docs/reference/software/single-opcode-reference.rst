Single character OPCODE list
****************************

This page is intended to be a quick list of all single character OPCODEs in use by the |DCC-EX| native commands and |EX-R| commands.

When investigating the feasibility of new features, discussions around an appropriate single character OPCODE arise, and this page is designed to assist in understanding which characters are available or in use to help facilitate those discussions and decisions, and select an appropriate character.

For information on |DCC-EX| native commands, refer to the :doc:`/reference/software/command-summary-consolidated`, and for information on |EX-R| commands, refer to the :doc:`/ex-rail/EX-RAIL-command-reference`.
