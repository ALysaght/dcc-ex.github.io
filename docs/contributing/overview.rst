Overview

We assume, since you got here, that you already have a computer up and running being either a Linux, macOS, or Windows machine, as well as a working internet connection and some disk space available. 

A 64 bit operating system is preferred, running as much as possible the latest version of your chosen OS. This in any case is good practice to keep your environment healthy and up-to-date.

The following sections describe what else you need for participating in the different efforts.

Development, planning, and support processes
_____________________________________________

There is a repository within the DCC++ EX GitHub organisation where are are slowly building out our project and support process documentation.

This repository will contain the various workflows, templates, and testing items we will use to ensure we release quality code with as few bugs (or "hidden features") as possible, and to ensure code is consistent across an internationally dispersed team.

This is our `Support Planning <https://github.com/DCC-EX/Support-Planning>`_ repository.

Contacting the team
