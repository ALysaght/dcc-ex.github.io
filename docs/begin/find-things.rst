While reading this documentation can help you understand what the capabilities and features of our products are, it can still be difficult to understand how they relate to what you want to achieve with respect to running trains, controlling accessories, or potentially animating various aspects of your layout.

Here is some guidance based on feedback from our users on what to look for based on the common use cases for |DCC-EX|.

I'm interested in DCC but have a very small budget
==================================================

That's perfectly ok! The |DCC-EX| project is free and open source software, using consumer grade, inexpensive microcontrollers and components to provide full feature DCC train control, and more.

You will get more features from our software than you will from many commercial DCC controllers, with the hardware components able to be purchased at a fraction of the price of these commercial systems.

At the moment, we don't offer ready-to-run solutions, but may do so in partnership with resellers down the track, so for the moment a willingness to do some DIY is required.

The only things we can't help you with are the layout and the DCC equiped locos!

I just want to run my trains
============================

If you simply want a system to run your DCC trains, then you only need to concern yourself with |EX-CS|, as this is our core digital controller product. While it can also do a lot more, you don't need to know about any other features or capabilities in order to use it to control trains only.

Note that you will need some sort of throttle or controller to connect to it also.

You will need to read through the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/index` documentation, and it will be helpful also to read through the :doc:`/throttles/index` section to become familiar with what throttle options are available.

This provides a very cost effective introduction to DCC train control using inexpensive consumer grade hardware and our (free) open source |EX-CS| software.

I want to operate my turnouts/points and run DCC trains
=======================================================

If you want your turnouts/points to also be controlled by |DCC-EX|, then this same |EX-CS| product has the capability to enable this also.

In addition to what you need to be familiar with for just running trains above, there is further information available on how to add and control turnouts/points in the :doc:`/ex-commandstation/accessories/turnouts/index` section.

I want some extra automated/animated realism
============================================

To start adding extra realism to your layout, such as controlling signal aspects when turnouts/points are closed or thrown, activating level crossing boom gates and lights as trains approach, or turning street lights off or on according to the time of day, this can be accomplished using the automation/animation capabilities of |EX-CS| which we call |EX-R|.

This uses a very simple to understand series of commands that can animate and automate various aspects of your layout.

Anyone can use |EX-R|, and over time we are building out practical examples to demonstrate how you can use this to automate or animate various aspects of your layout. We will also be publishing a series of "recipes" on this website as a sort of building block approach.

To make the most of |EX-R| you should read through the :doc:`/ex-rail/index` section as well as see the practical examples in :doc:`/big-picture/index`.

I want a fully automated exhibition layout for my club
======================================================

Are your club members sick and tired of having to perform repetitive, manual operations during club open days or exhibitions?

To take your demonstration layouts to the next level, spend more time talking to your visitors and potential club members by using |EX-R| to automate your layout.

This can be anywhere from a simple loop to stop and start trains at stations with automated arrival and departure announcements all the way through to multiple trains running throughout the layout, closing/throwing turnouts/points as required, setting signals, and crossing paths without collisions.

As per our automated/animated realism information above, be sure to familiarise yourself with :doc:`/ex-rail/index` and :doc:`/big-picture/index`.

Where to next?

To continue, it's helpful to understand that our documentation is aimed at different levels of users, from those who are brand new and don't know much about electronics or software, through to those with a lot of knowledge.
