What is DCC?
============

For those who have come across our website and don't really know or understand what Digital Command Control (DCC) is or does, then in a very short summary, it is essentially a way to control multiple trains on the same piece of track independently of one another (it is also much, much more than that).

With DCC, there is no need for multiple electrically isolated blocks to control multiple trains with multiple throttles any more.

To get a more in depth introduction to the DCC standand and protocol, you can read the `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control>`_ and `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Introduction_to_DCC>`_ introduction pages.

However, if you just want to know how DCC, and in particular |DCC-EX|, can help you run your trains and also add more realism to your layouts, then continue reading here.

DCC is for more than just controlling trains
--------------------------------------------

DCC, and in particular our flagship product |EX-CS|, can also be used to control accessories (think turnouts/points, signals, sensors to monitor things, and lineside feature animation to name a few). DCC is not just about trains!

There is a feature of |EX-CS| called |EX-R|, which uses a very simple to understand series of commands that can animate and automate various aspects of your layout, from simply setting signals based on the position of turnouts/points, to full automation of a train for use on exhibition layouts.

Of course you don't need to use any of these features if you simply want to run trains...

How to find what you're looking for
===================================

While reading this documentation can help you understand what the capabilities and features of our products are, it can still be difficult to understand how they relate to what you want to achieve with respect to running trains, controlling accessories, or potentially animating various aspects of your layout.

Here is some guidance based on feedback from our users on what to look for based on the common use cases for |DCC-EX|.

I just want to run my DCC trains
--------------------------------

If you have no plans or interest in doing more than simply controlling your DCC trains, then you only need to concern yourself with |EX-CS|, as this is our core train controller product. While it can also do a lot more, you don't need to know about any other features or capabilities in order to use it to control trains only.

Note that you will need some sort of throttle or controller to connect to it also.

This provides a very cost effective introduction to DCC train control using inexpensive consumer grade hardware and our (free) open source |EX-CS| software.

I want to operate my turnouts/points and run DCC trains
-------------------------------------------------------

If you want your turnouts/points and/or signals to also be controlled by |DCC-EX|, then this same |EX-CS| product has the capability to enable this also.
