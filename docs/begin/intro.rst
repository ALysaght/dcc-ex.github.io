What is DCC?
============

For those who have come across our website and don't really know or understand what Digital Command Control (DCC) is or does, then in a very short summary, it is essentially a way to control multiple trains on the same piece of track independently of one another (it is also much, much more than that).

With DCC, there is no need for multiple electrically isolated blocks to control multiple trains independently any more.

To get a more in depth introduction to the DCC standand and protocol, you can read the `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control>`_ and `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Introduction_to_DCC>`_ introduction pages.

However, if you just want to know how DCC, and in particular |DCC-EX|, can help you run your trains and also add more realism to your layouts, then continue reading here.

DCC is for more than just controlling trains
--------------------------------------------

DCC, and in particular our flagship product |EX-CS|, can also be used to control accessories (think turnouts/points, signals, sensors to monitor things, and lineside feature animation to name a few). DCC is not just about running trains!

Of course you don't need to use any of these features if you simply want to run trains.

Read on to understand which of our products and features will help you achieve your DCC dreams...
