What is DCC?
============

For those who have come across our website and don't really know or understand what Digital Command Control (DCC) is or does, then in a very short summary, it is essentially a way to control multiple trains on the same piece of track independently of one another (it is also much, much more than that).

With DCC, there is no need for multiple electrically isolated blocks to control multiple trains with multiple throttles any more.

To get an introduction to the DCC standand and protocol, you can read the `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control>`_ and `DCC Wiki <https://dccwiki.com/Introduction_to_DCC>`_ introduction pages.

DCC is for more than just controlling trains
--------------------------------------------

DCC, and in particular our flagship product |EX-CS|, can also be used to control accessories (think turnouts/points, signals, sensors to monitor things, and lineside feature animation to name a few). DCC is not just about trains!
